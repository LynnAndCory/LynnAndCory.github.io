        "This is when you first moved down to LA!! Trip to Rindge Dam! We made a trip to Rindge Dam with 
        my roommates and Julianne and Miss Boy! I was honestly really regretting that I took everyone there
        once we got there because I had forgotten how sketchy it was and I thought someone was going to die.
        But fortunately everyone was ok and we had a good time jumping off the big concrete slab!"
          <br> Love you stithy beans!

        was just a fun picture! Looks like this must be after we cut cat scratches because I see a bit
        of your eyebrow missing!"

        "Pasta eating competition! We challenged each other to a pasta eating competition because we both
        thought we could eat more than the other person! Your mom also decided to join in which was pretty
        cool! Not going to mention who won :) but afterwards I think I may have gone a bit delirious again
        and you were comforting me!"

        "More of our camping trip! On our trip we went for a few hikes. On one of them we found some cows
        which you proceed to chase because they were "so cute!" until one of them turned around and very
        loudly mooed at you hahaha. On another one of the hikes everyone else was walking too slowly and
        we were full of energy so we ran along the trail but then got worried we were going to get lost as
        the tracked out trail seemed to disappear! Finally we walked to the river where I brought I big
        rope in hopes of making a rope swing that did not happen at all haha. Fortunately we found this
        fun rock to jump off that was around 20 feet tall that is shown in the picture! The water was quite
        chilly so it was quick jump in and get out situation. We then proceeded to adventure down the river!
        Fun!"
          <br> Love you my dearest!

        "Dear hahahhaa! This camping trip was really silly, I feel like a lot happened so I'm gonna do two
        days of memories for this one. In this picture I think we're sitting around making s'mores and we
        were both pretty deep into the seltzers at this point and having a gay old time. I'm wearing your 
        hat and looking super sped. I do not remember which night was which but one night we had spaghetti
        tacos and the other night we had sloppy joes, both of which I thought were amazing! I think this is
        the only time we have camped together that wasn't in the backyard and I think we should do more of
        it!"

        "Dear this iconic day at the beach where we got our favorite picture of us that's now my lockscreen
        but I couldn't find it with the rest of the photos from the day because I think it was a polaroid
        we were sent afterwards. Anyway I had a really good time with you at the beach and I think this is 
        the day where I got dropped of at your house afterwards and I was really drunk and delirious! You
        cooked me pesto pasta while I lay in bed drifting off to sleep which was really sweet! But in my 
        madness I thought that you had been gone for hours so when I finally saw you I asked if you'd already
        eaten hahaha. I think I also mentioned popitsu in my delirium which I believe was either some kind
        of couples chair or bathtub that was molded to fit the couples' bodies??? I don't even know lmaooo" 
          <br> Love you shtew!!!

        "Dear our miniramp era haha! We spent a fine few afternoons at this sketchy little miniramp near
        the bumps. You learned how to pump back and forth and bravely attempted a few drop ins that did
        not go super smoothly hehe, fortunately you were alright! You were very supportive of me learning
        how to skate the miniramp which was really sweet!"

        "The drive in movies!! We have gone to the drive in theater I think three times in total! I do
        not remember if the first time was the hide and seek one or the one where they are hunting
        conservatives, but either way I remember it being really cozy and us eating lots of snacks! The
        most recent time we went to see Spider-Man and it was super cringe hahaha."

        "Our iconic Ocean Beach day where I first taught you how to skimboard! We have had many days like
        this but do not usually have my mom as our own personal photographer haha. I was watching back
        the videos and you were a natural! I forgot how good you were because you haven't done it so much
        recently, and have told me that you're bad at it so many times I was starting to believe you. But 
        you're really good! Right around this time we were regularly enjoying a lot of Tiger King
        together which we would watch on your phone in the back of the car! This was a routine that I really
        looked forward to doing with you!"

          "The start of COVID, we worked on painting the spikeball rims together quite a bit and you did a 
          really good job of cutting out the stencils when my glizzy fingers couldn't! Unfortunately (or 
          fortunately) COVID decided not to end for awhile. I don't really know what we were doing in the
          picture on the left haha but we did some temporary tattoos and look super sped ahhaha! I think
          your tattoo was an angel fish!"

        "Trip to Santa Monica! I think this was the time we skated there and we happened upon the LA
        marathon, which was great because we got to have the street to ourselves without any cars on it! I think you
        were riding Jonathan's penny board, and I remember at one part you started going really fast
        downhill and getting speed wobbles. I was very concerned and was convinced you were going down,
        but you managed to stay on your feet! Then of course I skated past a big dog which jumped at me and 
        I fell right over hahaha."

        we decided to do this haha. Also the picture of you handing me the glass of milk like a saint is

        together! I remember we didn't really know where we were going but just walked along 
        multiple paths until we had had enough which I think has been a theme for our hikes haha.
        You look really cute wearing my sweatshirt here!"

        a few rides together! Might be due for some more minigolf soon??"

        "Volcano Curry!! So yummy!!! We went here a couple times and you got the medium spicy and
        I got the very spicy because I was a masochist who was trying to prove his spice tolerance.
        One of the times we were here we bumped into Sean which was super random! Also what happened
        to the sweater you're wearing here it's really cute!?"

        were starting to get to know each other better. This includes our iconic first date to go
        see Us followed by pho at Saigon City which became a classic for us! I remember for our 
        first date I prepared a list of conversation topics so that I would make sure we didn't run
        out of things to talk about haha. Also you look really cute in your little orange hat!"
