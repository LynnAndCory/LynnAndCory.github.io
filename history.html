        "Fun hike just North of the Golden Gate Bridge. I think this was the first hike we went on
        together! I remember we didn't really know where we were going but just walked along 
        multiple paths until we had had enough which I think has been a theme for our hikes haha.
        You look really cute wearing my sweatshirt here!" 
          <br> Love you STINKER!!!

        "Wowwww graduation!!! The ceremony wasn't the most exciting but in the evening we went to
        the Santa Cruz Boardwalk and spent lots of time together! I remember playing the pirates 
        minigolf with you and then playing arcade games like air hockey! I think we also went on
        a few rides together! Might be due for some more minigolf soon??" 
          <br> Love you dearrrrr!!!

        "Volcano Curry!! So yummy!!! We went here a couple times and you got the medium spicy and
        I got the very spicy because I was a masochist who was trying to prove his spice tolerance.
        One of the times we were here we bumped into Sean which was super random! Also what happened
        to the sweater you're wearing here it's really cute!?" 
          <br> Love you BEAAANSSS!!!

        "San Mateo High School college flex day! We had gone on a couple dates at this point and 
        were starting to get to know each other better. This includes our iconic first date to go
        see Us followed by pho at Saigon City which became a classic for us! I remember for our 
        first date I prepared a list of conversation topics so that I would make sure we didn't run
        out of things to talk about haha. Also you look really cute in your little orange hat!" 
          <br> Love you dolly olly olly!!!

        "Look at us we're so cute! I remember it being really awkward at the Baba's house because
        all of the parents were watching us haha. Then at prom the DJing wasn't very good and we
        only danced together a little bit, but now we dance together all the time! Also I am a big 
        fan of the pink so good job picking that color dear!" 
          <br> Love you my sweet sweet sweet muffins!!!

          we had agreed to go beforehand! We were so cute and awkward around each other! I also
          remember talking to you about going to prom and how I thought you were really cool! This
          was the start of our journey to falling in love!"
