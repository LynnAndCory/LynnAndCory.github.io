        "At this point you were definitely living in your second airbnb with Joy and Julianne and we had gone skating
        around campus and near your airbnb a few times! I remember you landed a shuv-it and I was very 
        impressed! In this picture we went on a hike to this old nazi bunker, and we had to descend and
        then climb back up a ton of stairs!!"

        I don't look as bad as I thought I did haha. I think this was the time we went to get burritos and
        then picnicked in central park while some guy was running around with boxing gloves like rocky haha.
        We then made a classic of ours for years to come for dinner: fettucine alfredo!!"

        "After our hike we wanted ice cream, and I recommended black ice cream because it looks cool and
        we'd never had it! We got hasseled by a group of homeless people when we parked which was a bit
        scary, but we got our ice cream! It was really expensive (like $7) and also really big and really
        yummy! I think the flavor was like snickerdoodle or something, but the best part was that it was
        black! We should go back there some day!"

        "More of our camping trip! On our trip we went for a few hikes. On one of them we found some cows
        which you proceed to chase because they were "so cute!" until one of them turned around and very
        loudly mooed at you hahaha. On another one of the hikes everyone else was walking too slowly and
        we were full of energy so we ran along the trail but then got worried we were going to get lost as
        the tracked out trail seemed to disappear! Finally we walked to the river where I brought I big
        rope in hopes of making a rope swing that did not happen at all haha. Fortunately we found this
        fun rock to jump off that was around 20 feet tall that is shown in the picture! The water was quite
        chilly so it was quick jump in and get out situation. We then proceeded to adventure down the river!
        Fun!"

        "Dear hahahhaa! This camping trip was really silly, I feel like a lot happened so I'm gonna do two
        days of memories for this one. In this picture I think we're sitting around making s'mores and we
        were both pretty deep into the seltzers at this point and having a gay old time. I'm wearing your 
        hat and looking super sped. I do not remember which night was which but one night we had spaghetti
        tacos and the other night we had sloppy joes, both of which I thought were amazing! I think this is
        the only time we have camped together that wasn't in the backyard and I think we should do more of
        it!"

        "Dear this iconic day at the beach where we got our favorite picture of us that's now my lockscreen
        but I couldn't find it with the rest of the photos from the day because I think it was a polaroid
        we were sent afterwards. Anyway I had a really good time with you at the beach and I think this is 
        the day where I got dropped of at your house afterwards and I was really drunk and delirious! You
        cooked me pesto pasta while I lay in bed drifting off to sleep which was really sweet! But in my 
        madness I thought that you had been gone for hours so when I finally saw you I asked if you'd already
        eaten hahaha. I think I also mentioned popitsu in my delirium which I believe was either some kind
        of couples chair or bathtub that was molded to fit the couples' bodies??? I don't even know lmaooo"

        the videos and you were a natural! I forgot how good you were because you haven't done it so much
        recently, and have told me that you're bad at it so many times I was starting to believe you. But 
        you're really good! Right around this time we were regularly enjoying a lot of Tiger King
        together which we would watch on your phone in the back of the car! This was a routine that I really

        marathon, which was great because we got to have the street to ourselves without any cars on it! I think you
        were riding Jonathan's penny board, and I remember at one part you started going really fast
        downhill and getting speed wobbles. I was very concerned and was convinced you were going down,
        but you managed to stay on your feet! Then of course I skated past a big dog which jumped at me and
