        "Dear our miniramp era haha! We spent a fine few afternoons at this sketchy little miniramp near
        the bumps. You learned how to pump back and forth and bravely attempted a few drop ins that did
        not go super smoothly hehe, fortunately you were alright! You were very supportive of me learning
        how to skate the miniramp which was really sweet!" 
          <br> Love you stithy beans!!
