        "Dear this iconic day at the beach where we got our favorite picture of us that's now my lockscreen
        but I couldn't find it with the rest of the photos from the day because I think it was a polaroid
        we were sent afterwards. Anyway I had a really good time with you at the beach and I think this is 
        the day where I got dropped of at your house afterwards and I was really drunk and delirious! You
        cooked me pesto pasta while I lay in bed drifting off to sleep which was really sweet! But in my 
        madness I thought that you had been gone for hours so when I finally saw you I asked if you'd already
        eaten hahaha. I think I also mentioned popitsu in my delirium which I believe was either some kind
        of couples chair or bathtub that was molded to fit the couples' bodies??? I don't even know lmaooo" 
          <br> Love you shtew!!!
