        "Where it all started! I remember feeling really nervous to ask you out to prom even though
          we had agreed to go beforehand! We were so cute and awkward around each other! I also
          remember talking to you about going to prom and how I thought you were really cool! This
          was the start of our journey to falling in love!" 
          <br> Love you dear aka dolly aka stu aka honey bunches of oats aka stithy!!!
