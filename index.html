        "Fun hike just North of the Golden Gate Bridge. I think this was the first hike we went on
        together! I remember we didn't really know where we were going but just walked along 
        multiple paths until we had had enough which I think has been a theme for our hikes haha.
        You look really cute wearing my sweatshirt here!" 
          <br> Love you STINKER!!!
