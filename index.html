        "Volcano Curry!! So yummy!!! We went here a couple times and you got the medium spicy and
        I got the very spicy because I was a masochist who was trying to prove his spice tolerance.
        One of the times we were here we bumped into Sean which was super random! Also what happened
        to the sweater you're wearing here it's really cute!?" 
          <br> Love you BEAAANSSS!!!
