        "Fun day of skiing at heavenly! I remember that I was impressed with how fast you were going down
        all of the runs and you even sent a big side hit jump that landed you on your rumpus! I was also
        amazed with how you were able to ski without goggles on haha!"
          <br> Love you my dear!
