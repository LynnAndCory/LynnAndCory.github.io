        "More of our camping trip! On our trip we went for a few hikes. On one of them we found some cows
        which you proceed to chase because they were "so cute!" until one of them turned around and very
        loudly mooed at you hahaha. On another one of the hikes everyone else was walking too slowly and
        we were full of energy so we ran along the trail but then got worried we were going to get lost as
        the tracked out trail seemed to disappear! Finally we walked to the river where I brought I big
        rope in hopes of making a rope swing that did not happen at all haha. Fortunately we found this
        fun rock to jump off that was around 20 feet tall that is shown in the picture! The water was quite
        chilly so it was quick jump in and get out situation. We then proceeded to adventure down the river!
        Fun!"
          <br> Love you my dearest!
