        "I can't believe this was over two years ago! I feel like this was just yesterday! We had a
        gingerbread house building competition and we both had the same idea to build a pyramid (great
        minds)! We burnt the gingerbread and no winner was chosen but we had a good time haha!"
          <br> Love you stithy beans!
