        "Pasta eating competition! We challenged each other to a pasta eating competition because we both
        thought we could eat more than the other person! Your mom also decided to join in which was pretty
        cool! Not going to mention who won :) but afterwards I think I may have gone a bit delirious again
        and you were comforting me!"
          <br> Love you my love!
