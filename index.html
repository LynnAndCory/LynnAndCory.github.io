        "At this point you were definitely living in your second airbnb with Joy and Julianne and we had gone skating
        around campus and near your airbnb a few times! I remember you landed a shuv-it and I was very 
        impressed! In this picture we went on a hike to this old nazi bunker, and we had to descend and
        then climb back up a ton of stairs!!"
          <br> Love you my dearest!
