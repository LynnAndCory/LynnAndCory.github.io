        "The start of COVID, we worked on painting the spikeball rims together quite a bit and you did a 
        really good job of cutting out the stencils when my glizzy fingers couldn't! Unfortunately (or 
        fortunately) COVID decided not to end for awhile. I don't really know what we were doing in the
        picture on the left haha but we did some temporary tattoos and look super sped ahhaha! I think
        your tattoo was an angel fish!" 
          <br> Love you stithy mc stitherton!!!
