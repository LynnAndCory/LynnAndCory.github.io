        "After our hike we wanted ice cream, and I recommended black ice cream because it looks cool and
        we'd never had it! We got hasseled by a group of homeless people when we parked which was a bit
        scary, but we got our ice cream! It was really expensive (like $7) and also really big and really
        yummy! I think the flavor was like snickerdoodle or something, but the best part was that it was
        black! We should go back there some day!"
          <br> Love you dearrr!
