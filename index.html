        "Trip to Santa Monica! I think this was the time we skated there and we happened upon the LA
        marathon, which was great because we got to have the street to ourselves without any cars on it! I think you
        were riding Jonathan's penny board, and I remember at one part you started going really fast
        downhill and getting speed wobbles. I was very concerned and was convinced you were going down,
        but you managed to stay on your feet! Then of course I skated past a big dog which jumped at me and 
        I fell right over hahaha." 
          <br> Love you my darllll!!!
