        "Our iconic Ocean Beach day where I first taught you how to skimboard! We have had many days like
        this but do not usually have my mom as our own personal photographer haha. I was watching back
        the videos and you were a natural! I forgot how good you were because you haven't done it so much
        recently, and have told me that you're bad at it so many times I was starting to believe you. But 
        you're really good! Right around this time we were regularly enjoying a lot of Tiger King
        together which we would watch on your phone in the back of the car! This was a routine that I really
        looked forward to doing with you!" 
          <br> Love you my athletic queen!!!
