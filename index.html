        "San Mateo High School college flex day! We had gone on a couple dates at this point and 
        were starting to get to know each other better. This includes our iconic first date to go
        see Us followed by pho at Saigon City which became a classic for us! I remember for our 
        first date I prepared a list of conversation topics so that I would make sure we didn't run
        out of things to talk about haha. Also you look really cute in your little orange hat!" 
          <br> Love you dolly olly olly!!!
