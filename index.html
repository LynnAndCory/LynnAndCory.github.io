        "Our first official anniversary yay!!! You're wearing a really cute dress and a nice necklace and
        I don't look as bad as I thought I did haha. I think this was the time we went to get burritos and
        then picnicked in central park while some guy was running around with boxing gloves like rocky haha.
        We then made a classic of ours for years to come for dinner: fettucine alfredo!!"
          <br> Love you dolly dolly dolly with a side of beans!
