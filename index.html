        "Dear hahahhaa! This camping trip was really silly, I feel like a lot happened so I'm gonna do two
        days of memories for this one. In this picture I think we're sitting around making s'mores and we
        were both pretty deep into the seltzers at this point and having a gay old time. I'm wearing your 
        hat and looking super sped. I do not remember which night was which but one night we had spaghetti
        tacos and the other night we had sloppy joes, both of which I thought were amazing! I think this is
        the only time we have camped together that wasn't in the backyard and I think we should do more of
        it!"
          <br> Love you darllll!!!
